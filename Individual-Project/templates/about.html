	<h1>THE AGENDA OF LAGGENDA</h1>
	<p>From the age of two to 120, it is important to us that our customers, wherever they are, enjoy the best quality ice cream. point. And since quality equals freshness in ice cream, we chose to establish an active ice cream kitchen in every branch. In fact, all of Legenda's ice creams are created daily on site, without transport, in each of the chain's branches. 70 Something Our flavors are made by good, loving and skilled hands according to formulas and professions that use the best raw materials and fruits. That way, we can together ensure that the ice cream you receive in a cup or cup will be completely fresh, of high quality and always optimal.</p>

	<h1>THE STROY OF LAGGENDA</h1>
	<p>Dodo and Uri, childhood friends from Manhariya, were always told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. When they were released from the army and set out to fulfill a dream and travel the world, the two discovered that for their breakfast they mostly prefer... ice cream. From there, a new dream was born: to establish a quality ice cream parlor in Israel. So his uncle jumped to Italy to learn the ice cream tricks first hand and Uri prepared the ground on a business level. Today, 15 years and many branches later - Dodo and Uri still dream dreams together, still work together to fulfill them and still prefer ice cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner...

<h1>THE GELATO OF LAGGENDA</h1>
<p>With all due respect to ice cream (and there is respect!) there is nothing like gelato. What is the difference? You will be surprised, but the difference is... in the air. In the preparation of traditional Italian gelato, the high-quality ingredients are mixed slowly and carefully. Such mixing allows only a small amount of air to enter the freezer (about 20-30% air compared to 3 times in normal ice cream) and thus a rich, deep and full flavor is created. Want more differences between gelato and ice cream? you are welcome! While normal, industrial ice cream is produced in the amount of thousands of liters per flavor in order to optimize and save on production costs, real gelato is made in small batches. Here, at Legenda, we prepare only about 3-4 kg of each flavor each time so that you get it in its perfect texture every time.

<h1>THE RAW MATERIALS OF LAGGENDA</h1>
<p>Only the finest raw materials receive free entry into our kitchen. stabilizers? whey? vegetable oil? No thanks! Not in Legenda. Our gelato is based on the purity of the cream, the fresh milk and a variety of raw materials imported directly from Italy. We create our legendary flavors with the best additions, such as hazelnuts from Piedmont, excellent pistachios, truffles that we make ourselves and 100% real chocolate. In sorbet we use fresh or frozen fruits of excellent quality and use high quality mineral water. Our yogurt is natural yogurt and even on the sauces for decoration we do not compromise a millimeter.
